# Title: The Magic the Gathering Deck Creator

# Description

The app searches one of three parameters: "Card Name," "Card Color," or "Card Type" from a Magic the Gathering cards API. If you would like to use the API, it can be found here: 

https://docs.magicthegathering.io

The app returns a list of cards which users can scroll through and add to their "deck." If you find you've added a card you later decide you don't want, you can delete that card from your deck. The app allows users to check what cards are in the current deck before saving it. 

Users can create and edit their deck anonymously but in order to save, they must create an account. Once an account is created, all decks will be saved into the server and the user can return to view previously saved decks.

**The app is deployed here:** https://mtg-deck-creator.herokuapp.com/
